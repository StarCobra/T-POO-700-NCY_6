Subject: Introduction of a New Time Tracking Tool - Benefits and Assurances



Dear colleagues,

We are delighted to inform you that we will soon be introducing a new time tracking application within our company. We understand that the addition of new tools may raise concerns, which is why we want to highlight the positive aspects of this innovation while addressing your legitimate concerns.

Here are some benefits of our new time tracking tool:

User-Friendly: The application will be available on mobile devices, ensuring that all our employees can easily benefit from it, regardless of their equipment. This will allow everyone to clock their working hours without the need for a computer.

Day/Night Hour Separation: We are considering the possibility of separating day and night working hours in the application to accommodate the specific needs of our teams working non-traditional hours.

Trust and Non-Surveillance: We want to emphasize that this tool is not intended to monitor our employees but rather to regularize working hours. It is a means to ensure that all employees are fairly compensated for their efforts while ensuring compliance with labor regulations.

Simplicity for Managers: Managers will have access to an individual tracking dashboard for each employee over a 7-day period. This will greatly facilitate schedule management and help optimize company productivity.

Increased Productivity: For our managers, the tool will be a valuable asset to track their teams' working hours, ultimately contributing to increasing the efficiency of our company. For employees, it will ensure a stable work pace.

Verification of Reported Hours: We are considering the possibility for managers to verify hours reported by employees, but this will be done with respect for confidentiality and mutual trust.

We understand that change can be unsettling, but we want to assure you that this tool is designed in everyone's interest. It will ensure fair treatment of working hours, simplify management for our managers, and promote overall company productivity.

We will be available to address any questions and concerns as we roll out this new application. Our goal is to create an even more transparent and efficient working environment for everyone.

We remain available at any time for further explanations or additional feedback.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this initiative.

Best regards,
